Jumper J2   1/2 or 1 times clk
Jumper J1   22 or 24
Jumper J0   slave or master

The Jumper J2 is used to obtain half the frequency that you have cut on J1 the 22 or 24

for example J1 in 24 and J2 in position 1/2 clock your clock frequency is 12mhz
With the dip siwtch 3 on + you get 96k and on - 48k
If you want 192k you have to put J1 on 24 and J2 on full, not on 1/2 clock
Is that clear to you?
