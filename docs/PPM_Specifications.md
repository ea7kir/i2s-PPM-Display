# PPM Specifications

The most authortive source of truth I've been able to find is 
[Surrey Electronics PPM3,7,8.pdf](http://www.surreyelectronics.com/leaflets/PPM3,7,8.pdf)

Here's an extract..

## Type II PPM3 and PPM7 Specification

### Input impedance

PPM7 300kΩ balanced, 150kΩ unbalanced \
PPM3 60kΩ \
Input protected against static voltages on signal lines

### Input sensitivty fo Mark 4

PPM7 0dBV.7; -20 and -42dBV.7 strap-able, ±0.5dB \
PPM3 -14dBV.7, 150mV adjustable

### Scale law

4dB increments between Mark 1 Mark 7 (-12/+12dB)

### Low level performance

Isolated 10ms burst of 5kHz at 30dB below Mark 6 read gives 3% deflection

### Calibration accuracy

Marks 2,4,6 ±0.2dB; Marks 3,5 ±0.3dB; Marks 1,7 ±0.5dB

### Frequency response at any Mark

30Hz - 20kHz ±0.3dB; 10Hz -2dB; 40kHz -1dB

### Rise time

Response to isolated bursts of sine wave whose steady state amplitude deflects to Mark 6

100ms of 5kHz 0.0 ±0.5dB \
10ms of 5kHz -2.5 ±0.5dB \
5ms of 5kHz -4.0 ±0.75dB \
1.5ms of 5kHz -9.0	±1.0dB \
0.5ms of 10kHz -17.0 ±2.0dB

### Fall back time

Mark 7 to Mark 1 2.8 ±0.15s

### Dynamic linearity and overload characteristic

When above 1.5ms burst of 5kHz is altered in level between -20dB and +10dB, \
indications change in direct proportion. +30dBV.7 input sustained indefinitely

### Reversibility error

Bipolar rectification with 0.5dB at all Marks, any frequency 10Hz - 40kHz

### Distortion introducted into 600Ω signal line

Supply on or off, 20Hz - 20kHz at +20dBV.7: Less than -70dB, 0.03%

### Temperature stability

Zero ±1%, Mark 2 ±0.4dB, Mark 4 ±0.2dB, Mark 6 ±0.1dB

### Supply and tolerance

### Radio frequency immunity

### Slugged operation
